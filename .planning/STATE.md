## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Schema name is `listening` (onboarding doc 2026-04-19 is authoritative over Feb architecture doc)
- [Init]: All writes to `listening` schema use pool.query() or SECURITY DEFINER RPCs — PostgREST does not expose non-public schemas
- [Init]: SSO only via accounts.empowered.vote; JWT verified ES256 via JWKS; never set SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
- [Init]: Speaker/moderator UI is desktop-only in v1; mobile attempts get clean rejection message
- [01-01]: FK references use auth.users(id) per architecture doc v3 (onboarding doc example uses public.users — architecture doc wins for v1)
- [01-01]: fallacy_flags and summary_checks excluded from v1 foundation — deferred to Phase 7/8 feature implementation
- [01-01]: Stub migration files (empty SQL) required for shared-instance CLI history alignment — 116 stubs created for existing EV platform migrations
- [01-01]: Moderator UPDATE RLS policies deferred to Phase 2 SECURITY DEFINER RPCs; service role handles all writes in Phase 1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Open question — is "moderator" a distinct role from Empowered, or an attribute on an Empowered account?  Resolve before Phase 2 JWT token minting.
- [Pre-Phase 2]: Lincoln-Douglas total time is 32 minutes of segments vs 45 stated in design doc; 13-minute delta needs a definitive segment schedule before Phase 2 timer implementation.
- [Pre-Phase 4]: Deepgram vs AssemblyAI transcription provider decision deferred; A/B test on real debate audio recommended before Phase 4 commit.
- [01-01]: 116 stub migration files were created to align local Supabase history with existing remote EV platform migrations — these stubs will appear in future migration lists.  This is expected; the listening migrations are 20260420000000 and 20260420000001.
- [Pre-Phase 2]: listening_host and listening_moderator role slugs must be registered with accounts maintainer before role-check patterns can be implemented.
